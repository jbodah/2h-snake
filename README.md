# 2h-snake

## Overview

2-hour timebounded challenge to implement the game Snake using Godot

## Problems I Encountered

* Had to come up with a way to represent a discrete pixel grid. I previously failed hard trying to do this with a 2h Tetris clone.

## Lessons Learned

* Separating state manipulation from graphics rendering was a big win
* Finishing early meant I was able to add a lot of polish. The extra sound effects, death graphic, and speed ramp all make the game feel much more fun than it would've been without those
* ffmpeg can be used to convert MP3 to OGG
* I would've liked to have added a reset button after death but didn't have time
* I also didn't get to render the score anywhere aside from the console; that would've been a nice addition to show players
